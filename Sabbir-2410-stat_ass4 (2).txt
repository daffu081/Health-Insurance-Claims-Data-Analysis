1.
Gender Distribution:
sex
male      676
female    662
Name: count, dtype: int64

The bar chart shows the gender distribution among beneficiaries. Male and female beneficiaries are almost equally represented, with a slightly higher count for males. This balanced distribution ensures gender-related analyses are unbiased.

2.
Smoker Distribution:
smoker
no     1064
yes     274
Name: count, dtype: int64

This bar chart titled "Smoker Distribution" displays the count of individuals categorized as smokers ("yes") and non-smokers ("no"). The majority of the population are non-smokers, with over 1000 counts, whereas smokers are significantly fewer, with around 200 counts.
3.
Average Medical Cost by Region:
region
northeast    13406.384516
northwest    12417.575374
southeast    14735.411438
southwest    12346.937377
Name: charges, dtype: float64

 This bar chart shows the average medical cost by region. The Southeast has the highest average cost, followed by the Northeast, while the Northwest and Southwest have lower averages. This highlights regional differences in medical expenses.

4.This histogram illustrates the age distribution of beneficiaries. The highest count is among individuals in their early 20s, indicating this age group is the most represented. The distribution decreases for ages in the 30s and then stabilizes around the 40s and 50s, with a slight decline in representation for those in their 60s. The orange curve represents the smoothed density of the age distribution, highlighting trends across age groups.

5. The scatterplot shows medical charges versus the number of dependents, categorized by smoking status. Smokers (blue points) generally incur significantly higher medical costs across all dependent levels compared to non-smokers (orange points). The number of dependents has a limited direct impact on charges, with smoking being a stronger determinant of cost variability.

6.T-test for Smokers vs Non-Smokers Medical Charges:
T-statistic: 46.66492117272371, P-value: 8.271435842179102e-283
Smokers have significantly higher medical costs.

7.T-test for BMI of Males vs Females:
T-statistic: 1.696752635752224, P-value: 0.08997637178984932
No significant difference in BMI between males and females.

8.Chi-square Test for Smokers Across Regions:
Chi-square Statistic: 7.343477761407071, P-value: 0.06171954839170541
No significant difference in the proportion of smokers across regions.

9.ANOVA Test for BMI of Women with Different Numbers of Children:
F-statistic: 0.3344720147757968, P-value: 0.7158579926754841
No significant difference in mean BMI across groups.
